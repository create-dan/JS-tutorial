JS is interpreted language
Clent side scripted language which run in browser 
Js Engine 

Js code --> Js Engine --> Parser --> (Abstract syntax tree) --> machine code --> Run code and output


#2 Execuation context and  Execuation stack

Every browser has their own js engine like chrome has v8 

Execuation Context -- The environment in which our code is execuated and evaluated

Global Execuation Context -- Default 


Execuation Stack --> (Calling Stack)  stack -> last in first out

Es to store Execuation context (LIFO)


Whenever a function is called Execuation context for that particular function is created .

**** 3 Call stack and Execuation context ***

*** 18 NOV **

Creation phase and Execuation phase and hoisting 

1) Variable Object
2) Scope Chain
3) 'this' Variable


2 Phase -- 1) Creation Phase
           2) Execuation Phase



hoisting is js machanism where Variable and function declaration are moved to
top of their scope before the code Execuation

# scope Chain and lexical scoping


The Scope chain is used to resolve the value of Variable names in js

Scope Chain in js is lexically defined , which means that we can see what the scope chain 
will be by looking at the code .


lexical Scoping --> A function that is lexically within another function 
                    get access to the scope of the outer function .




    ** JS IS WEIRD ** 


use strict mode  --> new feature of ECMAscript 5

this statements instructs the browser to use the strict mode which is the reduced 
and safe feature set of js


*** This keyword in js ***

Different values depending on where it is used .

Referes to the object it belongs to 

Global object = window

Alone --> Global Object
Regular Function --> Global Object
Method --> Owner Object


In a function , in strict mode this is undefined .
